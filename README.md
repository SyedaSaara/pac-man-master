# pac-man
Vanilla JavaScript Game with HTML and CSS

A super simple walkthrough to coding Pac-Man in vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. View [here](https://pac-man-master.vercel.app/)

In this game, I show you how to make Pac-Man move around the grid while avoiding walls, and show you how to use the constructor method for all four ghosts to apply their unique characteristics to each one, including at what speed they move. Clyde obviously being the slowest.

### Inbuilt JavaScript functions I have used: 
* addEventListener()
* getElementById()
* querySelector()
* For Loop
* appendChild()
* createElement()
* push()
* if else statements
* classList
* switch case
* keyCode
* forEach()
* setTimeout
* Class
* constructor
* setInterval()
* removeEventListener
